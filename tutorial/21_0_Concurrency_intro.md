## 21.0 Concurrency

- Concurrency not equals parrallelism
- Go routines : lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, allowing concurrent execution of functions.
- Go runtime scheduler : Schedule goroutines inside an OS thread


- `go` keyword is used to create a new go routine
- sleep the main func for 100ms
	`time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)`
